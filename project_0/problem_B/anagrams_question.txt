Problem B -- Anagram Checker
----------------------------

An 'anagram' is defined as a 'word formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.'

Write a function that, given two words, returns 1 if the two words are anagrams, 0 otherwise.

Examples:
'anagram', 'raganam' -> 1
'listen', 'silent' -> 1
'meal', 'mole' -> 0
'happy', 'sad' -> 0

You can assume that all inputs are single words (no spaces or special characters) and all lowercase. As a hint, think about the relationship between the number of each character in a set of words that are anagrams.

The starter.cpp file contains tests that should all pass once you have implemented the 'are_anagrams' function correctly. You only need o modify the contents of the 'are_anagrams' function
